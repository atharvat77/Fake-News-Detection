                The ability to tell accurate news from fake news is an important skill that you'll use for the rest of your life.
                Fake news” is a term that has come to mean different things to different people. At its core, we are defining “fake news” as those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes. Sometimes these stories may be propaganda that is intentionally designed to mislead the reader, or may be designed as “clickbait” written for economic incentives (the writer profits on the number of people who click on the story). In recent years, fake news stories have proliferated via social media, in part because they are so easily and quickly shared online.

                Why should you care about whether your news is real or fake?<br><br>
    
    <b>1. You deserve the truth:</b>.  You are smart enough to make up your own mind - as long as you have the real facts in front of you.  You have every right to be insulted when you are presented with fake news, because you are in essence being treated like an idiot.<br><br>
    <b>2. Fake news destroys your credibility.</b>  If your arguments are built on bad information, it will be much more difficult for people to believe you now and in the future.<br><br>
    <b>3. Fake news can hurt you</b> and a lot of other people.  Purveyors of fake and misleading medical advice like Mercola.com and NaturalNews.com help perpetuate myths like HIV and AIDS aren't related, or that vaccines cause autism.  These sites are heavily visited and their lies are dangerous.<br><br>
    <b>4. Real news can benefit you.</b>If you want to buy stock in a company, you want to read accurate articles about that company so you can invest wisely.  If you are planning on voting in an election, you want to read as much good information on a candidate so you can vote for the person who best represents your ideas and beliefs.  Fake news will not help you make money or make the world a better place, but real news can.<br><br>
